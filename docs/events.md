# Upcoming

## RCIF Open House
Welcome to another year at the Research Computing and Informatics Facility (RCIF)! We have been hard at work developing resources to enable imaging research across the university and with our industry partners. Whether you are just curious or are a long-time user, we invite everyone to attend:

	RCIF Open House
	October 1, 2024
	FTLC, Holden Auditorium
	10am-1pm

REGISTER [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gkAjVXBKgbfWu2ZZerlVAJHL-rZJGLo2tnGPS1__zQ4)!
### Overview

We will discuss the various services we offer, important updates since last year, and our vision over the next 12 months, including details about data migration to our new data storage cluster!

About the RCIF (see also [https://docs.chpc.wustl.edu/](https://docs.chpc.wustl.edu/)):

- **Data retrieval**: We identify, acquire, and manage imaging data from WashU/BJC facilities, the CNDA, MIRRIR, and our informatics services.
- **Shared data**: We host several open imaging datasets (see [https://docs.chpc.wustl.edu/datasets/](https://docs.chpc.wustl.edu/datasets/)).
- **Portals**: Create externally available portals for customized data access and workflows
- **Data storage**: We provide nearly 20PB through our data facility and our Specialized Data Storage (SDS).
- **CHPC**: We offer massively parallel computing resources through the Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) with over 100 datacenter class GPUs and 1000’s of CPU cores, all with consistent access to data.
- **Server hosting**: We host servers, allowing dedicated computing resources with the ability to “burst” computing to our CHPC computing resources when needed – all with access to data.
