# Research Computing and Informatics Facility
The RCIF provides access to High Performance Computing resources, high-capacity and high-throughput storage, access to open and proprietary human imaging datasets, and the expertise necessary to tackle any computationally intensive human imaging project, including AI/ML applications. We offer the following services:

*   Access to a professionally managed High Performance Computing System (100Gbps InfiniBand HDR backbone network connecting 1,364 CPU-cores, 28 TB of combined memory, 4x A100 GPUs, 21x V100 GPUs, and 2x T4 GPUs to BeeGFS and Ceph high-capacity, high-performance storage) ... the next generation is already in process and will increase the GPU capacity by 5x (to 2.4PF)
*   Access to pre-installed software packages that support molecular modeling, advanced imaging, statistics and mathematical analysis (the current list isÂ [here](https://sites.wustl.edu/chpc/resources/software/)).
*   Access to software development tools including both the Intel compilers and MPI libraries.
*   Support for user access and the ability to request new software be added to the system.
*   Consultation with RCIF staff on parallel computing and software optimization.
