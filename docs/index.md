The **Research Computing and Informatics Facility** (**RCIF**) provides access to high-performance computing (HPC) resources, high-capacity and high-throughput storage, access to open and proprietary human imaging datasets, and the expertise necessary to tackle any computationally intensive human imaging project, including AI/ML applications. See [hardware](system-info/hpc-hardware.md) and [software](software/software.md) for more information.

This documentation is a community effort - please contribute [here](https://github.com/rcifw/rcifw.github.io)! Also, visit our [site](https://sites.wustl.edu/chpc/) for more (and sometimes the same) information.

## Citing the RCIF
In order to participate in future funding opportunities, we need you, the users, to cite the RCIF in your publications:

_Computations were performed using the facilities of the Washington University Research Computing and Informatics Facility, which were partially funded by NIH grants S10OD025200, 1S10RR022984-01A1 and 1S10OD018091-01. Additional support is provided The McDonnell Center for Systemes Neuroscience._

See current list [here](publications.md)

## Calendar of Events
**September 7, 2023** -- Stay tuned for more details on our mixer in East Imaging from 2:30-3:30pm!

**mid-October 2023** -- Stay tuned for more details on our all-RCIF open house!

## Organization of the Site
We tried to make this a (mostly) linear workflow, from getting an account to specialized applications and recipes for doing specific tasks.
1. [Requesting an account](getting-started/applying-for-a-user-account.md)
2. [Connecting to the cluster](getting-started/connect-to-login-nodes.md)
3. [Fundamental tools](under-construction.md)
4. [Building your application](under-construction.md)
5. [Importing and exporting data](under-construction.md)
6. [Testing your workflow](under-construction.md)
7. [Running your workflow](under-construction.md)
8. [Analyzing your results](under-construction.md)
9. [Tips and tricks for batch management](under-construction.md)
9. [Managing experiments](under-construction.md)
10. [Managing your jobs](under-construction.md)
11. [Asking for help](under-construction.md)
12. [Special services](under-construction.md)

## Additional Services

We offer the following services:

*   Access to a professionally managed High Performance Computing System (100Gbps InfiniBand HDR backbone network connecting 1,364 CPU-cores, 28 TB of combined memory, 4x A100 GPUs, 21x V100 GPUs, and 2x T4 GPUs to BeeGFS and Ceph high-capacity, high-performance storage) ... the next generation is already in process and will increase the GPU capacity by 5x (to 2.4PF)
* Access to pre-installed software packages that support molecular modeling, advanced imaging, statistics and mathematical analysis (the current list isÂ [here](software/software.md).
* Access to software development tools including both the Intel compilers and MPI libraries.
* Support for user access and the ability to request new software be added to the system.
* Consultation with RCIF staff on parallel computing and software optimization.
