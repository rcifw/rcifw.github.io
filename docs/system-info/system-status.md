## Current System Status
Our InfiniBand switches are currently undergoing maintenance, which may involve intermittent network interruptions for all
services. We expect this to be finished some time this evening (Feb 18).

### CHPC
All systems are operating normally at this time ... see notice above.

### NRG/Informatics Portals/CNDA/MIRRIR
We are currently experiencing a storage issue that has taken several production systems offline.  System administrators are addressing the issue, but we don't yet have an ETA for resolution.

#### If you are seeing an outage that is not reported here please contact:
