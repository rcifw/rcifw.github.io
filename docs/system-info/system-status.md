## Current System Status

### CHPC
All computing systems are operating normally

### NRG/Informatics Portals/CNDA/MIRRIR
We are currently experiencing a storage issue that has some systems (e.g. CNDA, BALSA, ECP) down.  Administrators are working on the issue but we don't yet have an ETA for resolution.

### Shared Storage Systems (Ceph, BeeGFS, ZFS)
We are currently experiencing a storage issue affecting certain ZFS storage pools.  Some storage datasets may not be available.
