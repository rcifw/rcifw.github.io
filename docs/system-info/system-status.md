## Current System Status

### CHPC
The following are currently offline for maintenance: `node07`, `gpu[07,09]`, `gpua[401,408]`. No other anomalies reported.

### NRG/Informatics Portals/CNDA/MIRRIR
**CURRENT OUTAGE:** We are experiencing a filesystem issue whereby writes to the Ceph filesystem are failing.  Most portals, including CNDA, MIRRIR and several others have been taken down to prevent write attempts that cannot be completed.

**OUTAGE UPDATE - 04:09PM Friday, November 14th**:  Metadata servers and storage are back online and the filesystem is healing.  However, connections to CephFS for filesystem access are still hanging.  We are investigating this issue.

### Shared Storage Systems (Ceph, BeeGFS, ZFS)
**CURRENT OUTAGE:** Ceph mounts are currently hanging/failing.
