## Current System Status

### CHPC
We are experiencing filesystem issues affecting multiple systems.  We are working on the issues but don't yet have an ETA for resolution. You may experience longer file I/O latency than normal, and some mounts have been seen to be intermittently unavailable. Please report issues on the [#ask-an-admin](https://mir-rcif.slack.com/archives/C05SQC1SJ0Y) channel and check for updates on the [#general](https://mir-rcif.slack.com/archives/C05R707TT7F) channel.

### NRG/Informatics 
We experiennced a major filesystem event affecting the storage pool hosting informatics portals and servers (CNDA, MIRRIR, IntraDB, ConnectomeDB, and others).  Systems administrators are working to move data and restore services, but portals are likely to remain down and offline until later this week.  We hope to have all services restored by the afternoon of Friday, September 27th.  We apologize for the outage and the inconvenience.
