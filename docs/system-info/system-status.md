## Current System Status

### CHPC
All systems are operating normally at this time.

### NRG/Informatics 
We experienced a major filesystem event affecting the storage pool hosting informatics portals and servers (CNDA, MIRRIR, IntraDB, ConnectomeDB, and others).  Systems administrators are working to move data and restore services, but portals are likely to remain down and offline until later this week.  We hope to have all services restored by the afternoon of Friday, September 27th.  We apologize for the outage and the inconvenience.

#### If you are seeing an outage that is not reported here please contact:

* CHPC:  *chpc@nrg.wustl.edu*
* CNDA and XNAT Portals:  *cnda-help@wustl.edu*
* MIRRIR:  *mirrir-help@wustl.edu*
* IntraDB:  *intradb-help@humanconnectome.org*
* All Others:  *cil-help@wustl.edu*
