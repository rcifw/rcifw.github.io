## Current System Status

### CHPC
All systems are operating normally at this time.

### NRG/Informatics 
We are currently experiencing a widesparead system outage affecting most applications and portals (e.g. CNDA, MIRRIR, IntraDB, etc.).  The server hosting system databases has become unresponsive.  We don't know yet whether there will be a quick fix, allowing systems to come back up in the next few hours, or if this will require moving data to a new server, which could take 1-2 days.

#### If you are seeing an outage that is not reported here please contact:

* CHPC:  *chpc@nrg.wustl.edu*
* CNDA and XNAT Portals:  *cnda-help@wustl.edu*
* MIRRIR:  *mirrir-help@wustl.edu*
* IntraDB:  *intradb-help@humanconnectome.org*
* All Others:  *cil-help@wustl.edu*
