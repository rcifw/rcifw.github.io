## Current System Status

### CHPC
The following are currently offline for maintenance: `login02`, `node07`, `highmem[01-02]`, `gpu[06-09]`, `gpua401`. No other anomalies reported.

### NRG/Informatics Portals/CNDA/MIRRIR
CNDA, MIRRIR and all portals are currently down due to issues with the ZFS filesystem on which their RDBMS metadata are stored.  Administrators are working to import data and machines are expected to be back online this AM.

### Shared Storage Systems (Ceph, BeeGFS, ZFS)
All systems are operating normally.
