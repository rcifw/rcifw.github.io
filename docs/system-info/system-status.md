## Current System Status

### CHPC
The following are currently offline for maintenance: `login02`, `node07`, `highmem[01-02]`, `gpu[06-09]`, `gpua401`. No other anomalies reported.

### NRG/Informatics Portals/CNDA/MIRRIR
CNDA, MIRRIR and all portals are currently down due to issues contacting their filesystems.  We are working on identifying and fixing the root cause but don't yet have an ETA for a fix.

We are currently experiencing filesystem issues.  We are working on identifying and fixing the root cause but don't yet have an ETA for a fix.
