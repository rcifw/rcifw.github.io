We have collaborated with Becker Library to provide a series of trainings/workshops on computer basics for users who had no prior experience of Linux OS and high performance computing (Computing 101) as well as basic programming in Python, R, and MATLAB.

More detailed information can be found at [https://becker.wustl.edu/services/research-computing](https://becker.wustl.edu/services/research-computing).

We also schedule periodic workshops, mixers, and user town halls to provide training opportunities for using the HPC facilities.
