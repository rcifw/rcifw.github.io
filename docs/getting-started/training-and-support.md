# Training and Workshops
Check [events](../events.md) for our current schedule.
# Support
For a guide to using the CHPC, see [Slurm basics](slurm-basics.md), and we have a short guide to debugging your scripts in our [debugging fundamentals](debugging-fundamentals.md) page.

You also have several ways of contacting us for one-on-one or crowd-sourced support.

* This documentation is a great resource for up-to-date information.
* Join our "Research Computing and Informatics Facility" workspace ([mir-rcif](https://mir-rcif.slack.com)) - email support for an invitation. This is an engaged and helpful community; feel free to post your questions to the community, or you can ask us for help directly on the [_#ask-an-admin_](https://mir-rcif.slack.com/archives/C05SQC1SJ0Y) channel.
* Receive news and advisories on the [CHPC Users email group](https://gowustl.sharepoint.com/sites/chpc-users); all new users are added when they receive an account on the CHPC.
* On campus? You can find us in Suite 2211 of the East Building.
* Email support for the various services, including CHPC (__chpc _at_ nrg.wustl.edu__), CNDA (__cnda-help _at_ wustl.edu__), and MIRRIR (__mirrir-help _at_ wustl.edu__).
* Check out our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rcifwustl) for additional content, including videos from user meetings and RCIF Open House events.
