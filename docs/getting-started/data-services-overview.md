The RCIF enables research through sharing of high value datasets under its **shared datasets program**, enabling acquisition, management,  and processing of original imaging research data through the **Central Neuroimaging Database Archive (CNDA)**, and facilitating creation, management and processing of large clinical-derived datasets through the **MIR Research Imaging Repository(MIRRIR)**.  The RCIF also operates a number of custom, branded imaging informatics portals to facilitate data aquisition, managment, sharing, and processing for a number of large, multi-site research projects.  
## Data Services

#### RCIF Shared Datasets Program
The shared datasets program makes broadly useful datasets available on a subscription basis to WashU imaging researchers.  Data are made available on the RCIF's High-Performance Computing Cluster (CHPC) via filesystem access.  [Click here for information on current datasets and to request access](rcif-shared-datasets.md).

#### Central Neuroimaging Data Archive (CNDA)
The CNDA facilitates acquisition, management, processing of original imaging research data.  All imaging data from CCIR scanning facilities is automatically archived in the CNDA and may be organized into projects for project investigators.  Free project setup is available for single-site WashU-based projects, however support for multi-site projects is also available.  The CNDA maintains connections to the clinical PACS, so original project data may be supplemented with clinical data.  Containerized pipeline processing via CNDA pipelines is available as well.  Documentation, tutorials, help and information on rates is available at the [cnda-help website](https://cnda-help.wustl.edu/).

#### MIR Research Imaging Repository (MIRRIR)
MIRRIR facilitates the acquisition, management and processing of large clinical datasets.  With connections to the clinical PACS and with Epic-certified staff, IRB-approved researchers can request a cohort of anonymized data based on their study's criteria.  Information on rates and services are available on the [RCIF Informatics Rate Page](https://wustl.box.com/s/dmuz8ch9qh9qgdcephr4zts0p4asitcz).

#### Custom Portals
For larger, often multi-site projects, the RCIF can set up and operate a custom, branded XNAT portal for facilitating the aquisition, management, and processing  of that study's data.   Information on services and rates for custom portals are available on the [RCIF Informatics Rate Page](https://wustl.box.com/s/dmuz8ch9qh9qgdcephr4zts0p4asitcz).
