### How can I onboard to use the cluster? (I have a WUSTL key).
You need to fill out the on the home page of our site; see the [account request form](https://sites.wustl.edu/chpc/).

### How do I upload my WUSTL HIPAA certificate?
1. Go to website Learn@Work: [https://sites.wustl.edu/learnatwork/](https://sites.wustl.edu/learnatwork/)
2. Click the red “Login to Learn@Work” button
3. Log in with your WUSTL Key username and password if required
4. Once logged in, you are taken to the Sabacloud dashboard:  Click the three horizontal bars icon at the upper left corner of this page (to the left of the Washington University in St. Louis logo). After the menu slides in, click the “Me” item.
5. Click the “Completed Learning” item in the left side menu
6. Type “HIPAA” in the “Learning Event Name” text box near the top of the main panel:  You should see the “HIPAA 101” course listed
7. Click the rectangular blue button marked “PRINT CERTIFICATE” in the right-most column of the results table in the “HIPAA 101” row (you may need to allow pop-ups in your browser)
8. Print the window that opens using a save-to-PDF option; this is the certificate which will need to be uploaded in the account application form

### How do I get CHPC access for outside collaborators?
This is a 4-step process:
1. An outside collaborator needs a sponsor at WashU to get a guest WUSTL-key which is necessary to authenticate to cluster. The collaborator can fill out the [guest account request form](https://connect.wustl.edu/guest/guestrequest/).
2. Like anyone applying for an account, the collaborator needs proof of completing some HIPAA-like training at their home institution, or HIPAA 101 training at WashU (a class in [Learn@Work](http://www.learnatwork.wustl.edu/)). Note that collaborators need to wait up to 24 hours after the WUSTL key has been assigned before taking HIPAA 101 training at WashU.
3. The collaborator needs someone at WashU to [request VPN access](https://wustl.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=5715eb474fa6fb8028a213701310c775&sysparm_category=e8249609dbb0d45c0b64ff00ba96195f&catalog_id=-1) through WashU IT.  It’s important to specify that the VPN access is needed to access the systems `128.252.185.7` and `128.252.185.8` (aka the login nodes at `login3.chpc.wustl.edu`), otherwise the VPN won’t work for logging into the cluster.
4. Fill out the [application](#how-can-i-onboard-to-use-the-cluster-i-have-a-wustl-key) and [upload the HIPAA certificate](#how-do-i-upload-my-hipaa-certificate)
