### How can I onboard to use the cluster? (I have a WUSTL key).
You need to fill out the on the home page of our site; see the [account request form](https://sites.wustl.edu/chpc/).

### How to get CHPC access for outside collaborators?
This is a straightforward 3-step process:
1. An outside collaborator needs a sponsor at WashU to get a guest WUSTL-key which is necessary to authenticate to cluster. The collaborator can fill out the [guest account request form](https://connect.wustl.edu/guest/guestrequest/).
2. Like anyone applying for an account, the collaborator needs proof of completing some HIPAA-like training at their home institution, or HIPAA 101 training at WashU (a class in [Learn@Work](http://www.learnatwork.wustl.edu/)). Note that collaborators need to wait up to 24 hours after the WUSTL key has been assigned before taking HIPAA 101 training at WashU.
3. The collaborator needs someone at WashU to [request VPN access](https://wustl.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=5715eb474fa6fb8028a213701310c775&sysparm_category=e8249609dbb0d45c0b64ff00ba96195f&catalog_id=-1) through WashU IT.  It’s important to specify that the VPN access is needed to access the systems `128.252.185.7` and `128.252.185.8` (aka the login nodes at `login3.chpc.wustl.edu`), otherwise the VPN won’t work for logging into the cluster.
