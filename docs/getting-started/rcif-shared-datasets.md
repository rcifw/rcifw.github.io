## Available Datasets

### HCP Young Adult
Human Connectome Project- Young Adult (HCP-YA) is a study of 1200 healthy young adult (ages 22-35) subjects from families with twins and non-twin siblings. Unprocessed and preprocessed MR data is available for 1113 subjects. 889 subjects have fully complete data for all of the four 3T MRI modalities in the HCP protocol: structural images (T1w and T2w), resting-state fMRI (rfMRI), task fMRI (tfMRI), and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (dMRI). 46 subjects (all monozygotic twins) have 3T HCP protocol Retest data available. 184 subjects also have 7T multimodal MR scan data available (in addition to 3T MR scans).  95 subjects also have at least some resting-state MEG (rMEG) and/or task MEG (tMEG) data available (in addition to 3T MR scans). More information on the dataset and processing with the HCP pipelines is available in the [S1200 Reference Manual](https://www.humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/s1200/HCP_S1200_Release_Reference_Manual.pdf). Behavioral data can be downloaded from [ConnectomeDB](https://db.humanconnectome.org/data/projects/HCP_1200), User support is available in the [hcp-users Google group](https://groups.google.com/u/0/a/humanconnectome.org/g/hcp-users). To get started, create a ConnectomeDB account and sign the Open Access Data Use Terms.

### OASIS
The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is a series of studies of aging and dementia in middle-aged to older adults. See [https://www.oasis-brains.org/#about](https://www.oasis-brains.org/#about). The studies include: 
* OASIS 1 - Cross-sectional MRI Data in Young, Middle Aged, Nondemented and Demented Older Adults
* OASIS-2: Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults
* OASIS-3: Longitudinal Multimodal Neuroimaging, Clinical, and Cognitive Dataset for Normal Aging and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
* OASIS3AV1451: Baseline OASIS-3 Flortaucipir F18 (AV1451) PET 
* OASIS3AV1451L: Longitudinal OASIS-3 Flortaucipir F18 (AV1451) PET
* OASIS-4: Clinical Cohort, aged 21-94

### UK Biobank
UK Biobank holds an unprecedented amount of data on half a million participants aged 40-69 years (with a roughly even number of men and women) recruited between 2006 and 2010 throughout the UK. Our copy of the dataset includes brain MRI, heart MRI, abdominal MRI, genotypes, and phenotypes. Brain imaging includes structural MRI, functional MRI, diffusion MRI, and susceptibility weighted MRI for over 40k session 1 and 3,400+ session 2 longitudinal subjects. Publication of image processing [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29079522/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29079522/). Our copy is managed by the Bijsterbosch lab who have provided documentation for use on the CHPC: UK_Biobank_use.

### TCIA
The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) is a series of radiology and histopathology imaging datasets. Imaging collections include data related to the images such as patient outcomes, treatment details, genomics, pathology, and expert analyses that are also provided or linked to when available. Collections are described at [https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collections/](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collections/).
 
Currently available TCIA datasets
#### Breast-Cancer-Screening-DBT
A curated dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images that includes normal, actionable, biopsy-proven benign, and biopsy-proven cancer cases.  The dataset contains four components: (1) DICOM images, (2) a spreadsheet indicating which group each case belongs to (3) annotation boxes, and (4) Image paths for patients/studies/views.

#### Duke-Breast-Cancer-MRI
A retrospective collection of 922 biopsy-confirmed invasive breast cancer patients including demographic, clinical, pathology, treatment, outcomes, genomic data, and dynamic contrast- enhanced (DCE) MRI. [https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70226903](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70226903)

#### ISPY TRIAL
Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular analysis is a national prospective study to test MRI for ability to predict response to treatment and risk-of-recurrence in patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Criteria for inclusion were patients with T3 tumors measuring at least 3 cm in diameter by clinical exam or imaging and receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with an anthracycline-cyclophosphamide regimen alone or followed by a taxane. This collection includes 230 patients. [https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20643859](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20643859)

#### ISPY2
Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular analysis 2 is an ongoing, multi-center trial designed to quickly evaluate the efficacy of new agents for breast cancer in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) setting [https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70230072](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70230072). 719 patients are included in this collection.

#### QIN_Breast_DCE-MRI
A collection of breast dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data from a longitudinal study to assess breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. [https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=18514286](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=18514286)

#### VICTRE
The VICTRE Trial is an open-source, in-silico clinical trial to investigate a new paradigm for evaluating digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) as a replacement for digital mammography (DM). A total of 2986 subjects, with breast sizes and radiographic densities representative of a screening population and compressed thicknesses from 3.5 to 6 cm, were simulated and imaged on in-silico versions of DM and DBT systems using fast Monte Carlo x-ray transport. Images were interpreted by a computational reader detecting the presence of lesions. The in-silico trial (VICTRE) was designed to replicate a comparative trial from a previous regulatory submission.
