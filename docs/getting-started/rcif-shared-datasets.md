# Available Datasets

## Curated Research Datasets

### ABCD
The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. 11,528 children ages 9-10 were recruited to track their biological and behavioral development for 10 years through adolescence into young adulthood. The ABCD structural and functional imaging data currently shared by RCIF is from the ABCD Release 2.0 (year 1, baseline) and was obtained through the ABCD-BIDS Community Collection ([ABCC](https://collection3165.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). DICOM data was converted to Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) data as input to the [DCAN Labs ABCD-BIDS MRI (version 0.0.3) processing pipeline](https://zenodo.org/records/3384983) which outputs [Human Connectome Project (HCP) Minimal Preprocessing Pipelines-style data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.127) in both volume and surface spaces in BIDS derivative format. Derivative output files for [ABCC Release 2.0](https://collection3165.readthedocs.io/en/stable/release_notes/) are described at [https://collection3165.readthedocs.io/en/stable/derivatives/](https://collection3165.readthedocs.io/en/stable/derivatives/). Phenotypic data from ABCD Release 5.1 on NDA is also available.

### HCP Young Adult
Human Connectome Project- Young Adult (HCP-YA) is a study of 1200 healthy young adult (ages 22-35) subjects from families with twins and non-twin siblings. Unprocessed and preprocessed MR data is available for 1113 subjects. 889 subjects have fully complete data for all of the four 3T MRI modalities in the HCP protocol: structural images (T1w and T2w), resting-state fMRI (rfMRI), task fMRI (tfMRI), and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (dMRI). 46 subjects (all monozygotic twins) have 3T HCP protocol Retest data available. 184 subjects also have 7T multimodal MR scan data available (in addition to 3T MR scans).  95 subjects also have at least some resting-state MEG (rMEG) and/or task MEG (tMEG) data available (in addition to 3T MR scans). More information on the dataset and processing with the HCP pipelines is available in the [S1200 Reference Manual](https://www.humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/s1200/HCP_S1200_Release_Reference_Manual.pdf). Behavioral data can be downloaded from [ConnectomeDB](https://db.humanconnectome.org/data/projects/HCP_1200), User support is available in the [hcp-users Google group](https://groups.google.com/u/0/a/humanconnectome.org/g/hcp-users).

#### ISPY TRIAL
Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular analysis is a national prospective study to test MRI for ability to predict response to treatment and risk-of-recurrence in patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Criteria for inclusion were patients with T3 tumors measuring at least 3 cm in diameter by clinical exam or imaging and receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with an anthracycline-cyclophosphamide regimen alone or followed by a taxane. This collection includes 230 patients. [https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20643859](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20643859)

#### ISPY1-Tumor-SEG-Radiomics
This dataset enhances the ISPY1 breast cancer data collection, with uniformly curated data, tumor annotations, and quantitative imaging (also known as radiomic) features corresponding to the tumor regions in 163 subjects. The segmentations included are for the entire 3D primary lesion, including both the enhancing and the non-enhancing tumor regions, therefore defining the structural tumor volume (STV) to allow analyses of the entire disease burden and analyses of tumor heterogeneity regarding contrast uptake.

#### Pancreas-CT
A collection of 82 abdominal contrast enhanced 3D CT scans from 53 male and 27 female subjects. Seventeen of the subjects are healthy kidney donors scanned prior to nephrectomy.  The remaining 65 patients were selected by a radiologist from patients who neither had major abdominal pathologies nor pancreatic cancer lesions.

#### VICTRE
The VICTRE Trial is an open-source, in-silico clinical trial to investigate a new paradigm for evaluating digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) as a replacement for digital mammography (DM). A total of 2986 subjects, with breast sizes and radiographic densities representative of a screening population and compressed thicknesses from 3.5 to 6 cm, were simulated and imaged on in-silico versions of DM and DBT systems using fast Monte Carlo x-ray transport. Images were interpreted by a computational reader detecting the presence of lesions. The in-silico trial (VICTRE) was designed to replicate a comparative trial from a previous regulatory submission.
