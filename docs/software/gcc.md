See the [GNU C Compiler project page](https://gcc.gnu.org/). To use GNU C Compiler, youâ€™ll use the `module` tool.

You can see what versions are available by using:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module avail gcc

------------------------------ /opt/modulefiles -------------------------------
   gcc/9.3.0

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
any of the "keys".
```

To load a specific version, you would use:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module load gcc/9.3.0
```

while the "gcc" wildcard will load the default version, gcc-9.3.0 in this case.

You should now be able to run GNU C Compiler commands:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ gcc --version
```
```
gcc (GCC) 9.3.0
