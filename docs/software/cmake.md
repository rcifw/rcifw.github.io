See the [CMAKE project page](https://cmake.org/). To use CMAKE, youâ€™ll use the `module` tool.

You can see what versions are available by using:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module avail cmake

------------------------------ /opt/modulefiles -------------------------------
   cmake/3.20.0

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
any of the "keys".
```

To load a specific version, you would use:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module load cmake/3.20.0
```

while the "cmake" wildcard will load the default version, cmake-3.20.0 in this case.

You should now be able to run CMAKE commands:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ cmake --version
```
```
cmake version 3.20.0-rc3
CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
```
