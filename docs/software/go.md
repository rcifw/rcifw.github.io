See the [GO project page](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). To use GO, youâ€™ll use the `module` tool.

You can see what versions are available by using:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module avail go

------------------------------ /opt/modulefiles -------------------------------
   go/1.15.6

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
any of the "keys".
```

To load a specific version, you would use:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module load go/1.15.6
```

while the "go" wildcard will load the default version, go-1.15.6 in this case.

You should now be able to run GO commands:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ go help build
```
```
usage: go build [-o output] [-i] [build flags] [packages]

Build compiles the packages named by the import paths,
along with their dependencies, but it does not install the results.
```
