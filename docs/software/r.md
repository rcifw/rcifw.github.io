The R home page is [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).

To use R, you’ll want to use Anaconda distributions (see [Python](python.md) for instructions on how to setup your conda environment), which come pre-bundled with many R packages. Regardless of which R package you use, you need to set up a R environment similar to Python Virtual Environment using conda command. This will allow you to update or install any packages that you’d like.

You can now create a R environment with:

```
[me@login01 ~]$ conda create -n <name_of_env> <r_package_needed>
```

where can be whatever you want to call it.

To activate this environment, use:

```
[me@login01 ~]$ source activate <name_of_env>
```

To activate this environment, use:

```
[me@login01 ~]$ conda deactivate
```

To install R packages within this environment, you can start R, and then use “install.packages()” command.

An example of creating a new R environment is shown here:

```
[me@login01 ~]$ conda create -n r-env r-essentials r-base
[me@login01 ~]$ source activate r-env
(r-env) [me@login01 ~]$ R

As you don’t have permission to write to the system temporary directory, when you install R packages in your R environment, you may encounter an error like:

```
ERROR: 'configure' exists but is not executable -- see the 'R Installation and Administration Manual'
```

To solve this issue, you need to create a temporary directory in a folder where you have full permission, for instance, your scratch folder. Then, you set TMPDIR variable to this temporary directory.

```
[me@login01 ~]$ mkdir /scratch/me/tmp
[me@login01 ~]$ chmod 755 /scratch/me/tmp
[me@login01 ~]$ export TMPDIR=/scratch/me/tmp
```

After this, you can start R and install packages within as the new temporary directory is writable and executable by you.

```
> tempdir()
[1] "/scratch/me/tmp//RtmpXbI3Sg"
```

You can also use conda command **conda install -c r package-name** to install R packages given they are available in the Anaconda repository. A complete list of these packages can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/r-language-pkg-docs/).

```
(r-env) [me@login01 ~]$ conda install -c r r-bayesm
(r-env) [me@login01 ~]$ R
> library(bayesm)
```
