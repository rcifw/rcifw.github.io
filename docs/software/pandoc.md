See the [PANDOC project page](https://pandoc.org/). To use PANDOC, youâ€™ll use the `module` tool.

You can see what versions are available by using:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module avail pandoc

------------------------------ /opt/modulefiles -------------------------------
   pandoc/3.1.9

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
any of the "keys".
```

To load a specific version, you would use:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module load pandoc/3.1.9
```

while the "pandoc" wildcard will load the default version, pandoc-3.1.9 in this case.

You should now be able to run PANDOC commands:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ pandoc --version
```
```
pandoc 3.1.9
