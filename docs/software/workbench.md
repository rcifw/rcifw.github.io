See the [WORKBENCH project page](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench). To use WORKBENCH, you’ll use the `module` tool.

You can see what versions are available by using:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module avail workbench

------------------------------ /opt/modulefiles -------------------------------
   workbench/2.0.1

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
any of the "keys".
```

To load a specific version, you would use:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module load workbench/2.0.1
```

while the "workbench" wildcard will load the default version, workbench-2.0.1 in this case.

You should now be able to run WORKBENCH commands:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ wb_command
```
```
Version: 2.0.1

If the first argument is not recognized, all processing commands that start
  with the argument are displayed.
