See the [FastQC project page](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). To use FastQC, youâ€™ll use the `module` tool.

You can see what versions are available by using:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module avail fastqc

------------------------------ /opt/modulefiles -------------------------------
   fastqc/0.12.1

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
any of the "keys".
```

To load a specific version, you would use:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module load fastqc/0.12.1
```

while the "fastqc" wildcard will load the default version, fastqc-0.12.1 in this case.

You should now be able to run FastQC commands:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ fastqc --version
```
```
FastQC v0.12.1
```
