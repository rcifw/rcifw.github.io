See the [OCTAVE project page](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index). To use OCTAVE, youâ€™ll use the `module` tool.

You can see what versions are available by using:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module avail octave

------------------------------ /opt/modulefiles -------------------------------
   octave/7.3.0

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
any of the "keys".
```

To load a specific version, you would use:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module load octave/7.3.0
```

while the "octave" wildcard will load the default version, octave-7.3.0 in this case.

You should now be able to run OCTAVE commands:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ octave
```
```
GNU Octave, version 7.3.0
