See the [Perl project page](https://www.perl.org/). To use Perl, youâ€™ll use the `module` tool.

You can see what versions are available by using:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module avail perl

------------------------------ /opt/modulefiles -------------------------------
   perl/5.10.1

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules and extensions.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
any of the "keys".
```

To load a specific version, you would use:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ module load perl/5.10.1
```

while the "perl" wildcard will load the default version, perl-5.10.1 in this case.

You should now be able to run Perl commands:
```
[me@login01 ~]$ perl --version
```
```
This is perl, v5.10.1 (*) built for x86_64-linux
